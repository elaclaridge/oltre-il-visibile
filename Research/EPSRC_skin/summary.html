<H2>Summary</H2>
This research is concerned with the characterisation of 
pigmented skin lesions in the context of early diagnosis of malignant 
melanoma. The goal is to improve the diagnostic accuracy beyond that 
currently attainable through routine clinical examination and through 
existing image analysis methods.
<p>
A new skin image analysis method developed by our group generates 
parametric images characterising skin structure and composition. A critical 
novelty of the method is that it exploits physics of image formation and 
uses an optical model of the skin to interpret the colours occurring in a 
lesion image in terms of lesion histology. Information contained in the 
parametric images computed through the use of the model complements 
that available in direct images, whether 
examined visually or by conventional image analysis. It is thus likely to 
help in lesion discrimination.
<p>
Quantitative measures derived from the parametric images will 
characterise the amount, location and distribution of melanin and blood and 
the architectural distortions induced by lesions, including the presence of 
melanin in the dermis often associated with malignant melanoma. 
<p>
Experimental validation on a large image database will establish whether 
the data provided by the new image analysis method improves diagnosis of 
early melanoma.


<H2>Objectives</H2>
<ul>
<li> To experimentaly validate the potential of the new skin image analysis 
method to discriminate between melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions 
<p>
<li> To develop algorithms for deriving quantitative parameters 
characterising skin lesions from the images produced by the new method.
<p>
<li> To establish the predictive value of these parameters in the detection of 
early signs of melanoma.
<p>
<li> To contribute to the development of a prototype system to be used in a 
clinical setting.
<p>
<li> To investigate the clinical potential of the new skin image analysis 
method through experimental validation on a large set of lesion images 
representing a range of clinical problems.
</ul>
