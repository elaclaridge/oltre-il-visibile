<h2>Context</h2>

Computer image interpretation is concerned with applying computational and
mathematical techniques to digital images in order to extract specific
information from image data. Most methods have been developed to interpret
images of the three-dimensional world. As surfaces were considered to be
the most ecologically important structures of the world, images were
assumed to represent primarily light reflected from surfaces [1-2]. The
originality of our method stems from the insight that the "appearance of a
surface [...] is a result of [...] processes at and within this
surface"[3]. This insight is at the heart of a novel and generic method of
image interpretation which complements the existing techniques.
<p>
The image is considered to be the product of the interaction of light with
the constituents of the scene. The physics of light transport is utilised
to construct a spectral characterisation model - a mathematical model
capable of predicting the range of colouration expected from materials
known to occur within the scene. By comparing image data to these
predictions material characteristics can be deduced.
<p>
Our group has successfully applied this approach to develop a novel skin
imaging system [4-5]. From two images of the skin, one colour and one
acquired through a near-infrared filter, informative parametric maps are
computed, containing detailed information about the concentration of
melanin and blood and collagen thickness across the imaged skin [5].
Current medical trials are showing the maps to be of great value in the
diagnosis of melanoma [6]. 

<h2>Objectives</h2>
The ultimate goal of the project is to formulate a generic approach to
image interpretation based on the spectral characterisation models. This
should enable the structure and composition of the materials and tissues 
to be deduced from their images acquired through a small number of optical
filters using a standard digital camera.
<p>
The specific objectives of this work are to:
<ul>
<li>Develop theoretical foundations for the new imaging method so that the
relevant aspects of various contributing disciplines are brought together
into a unified framework.
<li>Develop a principled approach  to specifying how the general method is to
be applied to various specific materials, including predictions of whether
a particular class of materials is suitable for this kind of analysis.
<li>Develop methodology for predicting optimal filters for specific materials.
<li>Develop at least two examples of the application of the method to real
materials.
</ul>

<h2>Significance and originality</h2>
The proposed project is interdisciplinary, it draws ideas from physics,
chemistry, applied mathematics, computer science and visual perception.
Together, these ideas expand the boundaries of what is currently possible
through image interpretation.  
<p>
The key novelty of our approach is in its development and exploitation of
the spectral characterisation models of specific materials. The structure
of the model allows us to create a simple cross-reference between the
object composition and its colour (or some richer spectral
characterisation). As the model is constructed using physics (rather than,
for example, statistics) the physical origin of colours seen in images can
be explained with reference to the actual physical phenomena. The
mathematical form of the model allows us to take advantage of the well
developed spectrophotometric quantitative methodologies whilst presenting
the results as images, which convey rich spatial information.
<p>
The practical significance of the proposed method is that for suitable
classes of materials, quantitative estimates of their composition can be
obtained from their image data. The method is instant and non-invasive.
Once a set of optical filters is defined for a given class of material,
the filtering during the image acquisition phase followed by nearly real
time post-processing enables appropriate image sets  to be presented for
interpretation. The underlying scientific technique is fundamentally
generic and is the potential basis of a unique non-destructive testing
technology which does not require complex equipment and could be
implemented using only a digital camera with filters. The applicability of
the method to a given class of materials can be assessed due to the
underlying predictive theory.

<h2>Methods</h2>
To construct spectral characterisation models we shall use the well known
`Monte Carlo' computational method. By supplying parameters characterising
a given material (the number and thickness of layers, optical coefficients
of the layer components, etc),  this method can be used to computationally
simulate interactions of light photons with the material and generate the
spectrum(a) characterising the remitted light. A collection of such
spectra, linked to the input parameters, is a spectral characterisation
model.
<p>
A spectrum specifies the light levels associated with each of several
hundred discrete spectral wavelengths. Although it is possible to acquire
digital images corresponding to many wavelengths, this is costly in terms
of storage space and processing time. Standard colour video cameras
"compress" the whole light spectrum to just three components: red, green
and blue. This is achieved by filtering the incoming light through red,
green and blue filters. Most people find that this represents images quite
adequately, because these three filters are tuned to the colours that the 
human visual system perceives best. These filters are, however, unlikely
to be the best choice for all the materials. One of the most important
parts of the project is to develop general methods for defining filters
which would be most appropriate for specific materials. An ideal filter
will produce an image showing even small variations in a property of  a
single component of a material. There exist statistical and mathematical
methods for finding such "optimal" filters. 
<p>
Finally, to evaluate the methodology, the developed techniques will be
practically applied to images from two different domains. Possible
candidate domains include agriculture, ophthalmology and remote sensing.
