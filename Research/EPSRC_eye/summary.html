Diabetic retinopathy is the largest single cause of blindness amongst 
working age population in the United Kingdom. If pathological changes 
are detected early, appropriate measures taken to prevent loss of sight are 
likely to be more effective. 
<p>
This project aims to develop and validate a new physics based image 
interpretation method for the ocular fundus and to evaluate its potential in 
detecting early signs of diabetic retinopathies. An understanding of the 
physical interaction of light with ocular tissue is utilised to formulate a 
mathematical model capable of predicting colours which correspond to 
different tissue composition. Colours in digitized clinical images will be 
interpreted through reference to this model, generating "retinal maps" 
which show separately the quantities and distribution of blood, retinal 
pigment and pathological exudates at every image point. In clinical use 
the maps would be viewed alongside the conventional image, helping 
clinical interpretation by highlighting changes, showing the presence of 
pathologies and removing the masking effect of melanin on small blood 
variations. For the patient, the new method would be no more onerous 
than current fundus photography, but the instant availability of the retinal 
maps would enhance the effectiveness of retinal photographic screening, 
allowing prompt feedback to the patient and referring medical staff.
